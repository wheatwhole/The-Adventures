# THE ADVENTURES: Continuing the Journal 

## The Return (basically a recap)
Well, not really part 1. Unfortunately I died, respawned and lost my minecraft journal to the grave. I remember back at my old house (i moved to a new one in the snowy mountains), That I first worked for 20-30 days on a lake house, got a pet dog, and began to work on the huge mineshaft. Later on, I got bored of the house so I took all of my belongings to a far away snow biome and built a house over there. My dog was lost, so all I have is my friends dog. I hope to return to my friends dog and give him a good pet and feed him someday. As for now, I have not made a lot of progress in my new location. I will return to my old house since I miss it.

Here is a journal entry that was preserved:

<i>day 69
[-------------------]

And here are the coordinates for my different waypoints:

-134 63 -29
-88 63 -491
480 84 -470 (best for iron and coal)
588 84 -917 (second base)
-3564 67 788 -3521 66 813

Maybe I should get a map soon. Im not saying this adventure is bad or anything, its really fun!</i>

Wow, I havent written for a pretty long time in this journal. Heres what happened in the past days: 
- I finished the exterior of the mineshaft and now	 im digging down to the different levels (such as coal level, iron level, and if possible, diamond level. 

- Me and Frostbite (my cousin) decided to go mining but we died and lost all of our items, spawning back at the world spawn so we had to travel hundreds of blocks. 

- My sister died without a bed so we have to find her again. Oh, and I also found my old journal (probably day 1- 90 something?) since frostbite managed to save it. The days in it are inacurrate since we got a day counter. 

- Also, fixed the bedrock bugs by uninstalling PowerToys. Tried raiding the pillager base but they keep respawning, now I have bad omen.

That leads us up to day 193.

### [DAY 205]

Me and frostbite decided to team up and raid a pillager base since it was blocking our back and forth path between biomes. Even though we killed all of them i was left with one heart. Suddenly those pillagers respawned, and I realized there was no point in killing them over and over. 


### [sad news about the dogs]

Unfortunately, both of our dogs had died and have not been able to join us in the adventures :(. The cause of my first dogs death was me accidentally hitting him into a lava pool when defending him from a skeleton, then my dog burning alive. There was nothing I could do to save him as the lava killed him too quickly. I went ahead to kill the skeleton, and to this day skeletons are my least favorite, most stupid mobs I know. Later on Frostbite got a dog we would share, and I made sure to protect it from all dangers. When we were moving to t (note: coming back to this i probably didnt get to finish this part or save it)
