# The Adventures by wheatwhole
A pretty epic journal that I made based off my minecraft world, The Adventures. Well, it isnt so epic right now, since I literally just explain what I did, but once I add some story to it it will be cool.
The entire journal can be found [here](https://github.com/wheatwhole/The-Adventures/blob/b82a428ae54df77c90a4353214a6dea129ab9340/The%20Adventures.md)

## Interested in joining The Adventures?
Welll, im pretty slow in this game. Its like day 200 or something I dont know and I STILL dont have diamonds bruh not even netherite.
Im not sure how I would be able to let you join if its bedrock. I can try making a public proxy LAN server thats accessible across the world, but it can only be done on Java. If I find a way to do that on bedrock, maybe it will be possible to join.
